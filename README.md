# Examining Trends in Teen Birth Rate, Access to Early Prenatal Care, and Babies with Low Birth Weight in Maryland, 2010-2017

## Metrics
   - Teen birth rate: rate of births to teens ages 15-19 years (per 1,000 population).
   - Early prenatal care: percentage of pregnant women who receive prenatal care beginning in the first trimester
   - Babies with low birth weight: percentage of live births that are a low birth weight (2500 grams or less)

## Problem
  How have teen birth rate, access to early prenatal care, and the number of babies with low birth weight changed from 2010 to 2017 in Maryland's counties? How can this inform policy? 

## Data Sources
   - We used data from the [Maryland Open Data Portal](https://opendata.maryland.gov/) to examine these three variables
   - We used health data from the SHIP program-- which falls under Human and Health Services-- because it was fairly consistent across variables
      - SHIP is te State Health Improvement Process
